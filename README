Moongo is a Java library, which aims to be an easy interface to play with MongoDB.

There are two main objects you would use with Moongo:
 1. Moongo
 2. QueryObject

The first one, is the main object which wraps all methods you would like to use.
The second one, is the object used to create query criterias.
